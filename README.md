## Design


### Colour Scheme


Because this game is designed to be enjoyable for children I opted to go for a really bright, colorful and cheerful color scheme. Some of the research I undertook on UX for children can be found on[Children-first-design](https://uxdesign.cc/ux-for-kids-responsible-matter-802bd12fe28c).

To meet WCAG 2.0 criteria, the color scheme was then passed to [eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to generate an accessibility table, I then only used accessible text colors to ensure easy reading.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

Again because this is a game with children in mind I used fun, kiddy fonts designed to entertain.

For The headings I used Kranky, its a fun-filled font with is very stylised ideal for headings:

For the more dense parts of text, like the initial question and rules I used Indie Flower, again designed to be fun:

### Images

All the images were taken from [www.vecteezy.com/](https://www.vecteezy.com/) with no attribution required.
The images chosen are to enhance the UX for the target audience. The images are bright and cartoonish matching the games animal theme and looking to entertain the user.

### Wireframes

Balsamiq was used to design my wireframes.

Because the game requires a specific layout the wireframes remain the same across all devices.
The site is responsive and does ajust image and font size depending on device size but the layout remains the same.
