# Elephant Mouse Monkey

This is a variation of the 'Rock' 'Paper' 'Scissor' game but with fun twists designed to keep children entertained.

You can choose your own 'destination' of either the Forrest, Savannah or Meadow to play, you then pick 'Elephant' 'Mouse' or 'Monkey' to battle the computer to see who comes out on top.

Everyone knows that Mice scare Elephants, Monkeys catch Mice and that Elephants squash Monkeys!!

### Colour Scheme


Because this game is designed to be enjoyable for children I opted to go for a really bright, colorful and cheerful color scheme. Some of the research I undertook on UX for children can be found on[Children-first-design](https://uxdesign.cc/ux-for-kids-responsible-matter-802bd12fe28c).

To meet WCAG 2.0 criteria, the color scheme was then passed to [eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to generate an accessibility table, I then only used accessible text colors to ensure easy reading.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

Again because this is a game with children in mind I used fun, kiddy fonts designed to entertain.

For The headings I used Kranky, its a fun-filled font with is very stylised ideal for headings:

For the more dense parts of text, like the initial question and rules I used Indie Flower, again designed to be fun:

### Images


### Wireframes

Balsamiq was used to design my wireframes.

Because the game requires a specific layout the wireframes remain the same across all devices.
The site is responsive and does ajust image and font size depending on device size but the layout remains the same.
