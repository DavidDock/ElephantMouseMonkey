### Colour Scheme


Because this game is designed to be enjoyable for children I opted to go for a really bright, colorful and cheerful color scheme, picking the brightest colors to keep the children entertained. The research I did and advice I took was from [Children-first-design](https://uxdesign.cc/ux-for-kids-responsible-matter-802bd12fe28c).

To meet WCAG 2.0 criteria, the color scheme was then passed to [eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to generate an accessibility table, I then only used accessible text colors to ensure easy reading.

### Wireframes


Because the game requires a specific layout the wireframes remain the same across all devices.
The site is responsive and does ajust image and font size depending on device size but the layout remains the same.
